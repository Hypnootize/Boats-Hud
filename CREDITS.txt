OH MY GOD THIS TOOK WAY LONGER THAN IT SHOULD'VE

HUGE THANKS TO KRAKEN THE BESTEST BUD I COULD'VE HAD THROUGH DEVELOPMENT
HIS CRITICISM AND ADVICE WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE END PRODUCT AS GOOD AS IT IS

HUGE THANKS TO SPOOTLY, THE BESTEST BETA TESTER AND BUG REPORTER A GUY COULD ASK FOR

HUGE THANKS TO RAWRSOR, FOR TEACHING ME HOW TO CODE THE LOADOUT PANELS

HUGE THANKS TO YOU FOR READING THE CREDITS, IT FEELS GOOD TO KNOW YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT

OH MY GOD MY STRESS LEVELS

CHEERS LADS
